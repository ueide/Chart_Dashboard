# Chart_Dashboard
Visualise data clearly through a well-designed chart


## Description
This project focuses on developing a data visualisation platform by utilising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. It involves transforming raw data into an easily understandable visual format, primarily through the development of an intuitive dashboard. Key techniques employed include the use of variables, functions, constructor functions, loops, and other programming concepts to ensure the platform is both functional and user-friendly.
